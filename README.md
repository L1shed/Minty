## How do I install this client?

### Steps:

1. **Download the latest .jar file from the releases**:
   - Download from [https://github.com/xia-mc/Raven-XD/releases](https://github.com/xia-mc/Raven-XD/releases)
   - This client requires Forge 1.8.9.

2. **Put in mods folder of your .minecraft directory**:
   - If you don't already have this, please install Forge 1.8.9 by clicking installer, and clicking skip after 5 seconds (https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html).
   - Once you've done that, open file explorer, and in the search bar type %Appdata%. Once you're there navigate to .minecraft, then finally the folder called "mods".
   - After you're there, all you have to do is drag the file that you just downloaded there.

3. **Launch Minecraft**:
   - Once your on this step, you are pretty much done. When it's done loading, if you have done it properly, it should have a background with a train and the string "Raven XD" in big white letters.
   - For more help, join the discord server and ask in #public-support.
